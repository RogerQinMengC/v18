title: Feature Engineering in User’s Music Preference Prediction
abstract: 'The second track of this year’s KDD Cup asked contestants to separate a
  user’s highly rated songs from unrated songs for a large set of Yahoo! Music listeners.
  We cast this task as a binary classification problem and addressed it utilizing
  gradient boosted decision trees. We created a set of highly predictive features,
  each with a clear explanation. These features were grouped into five categories:
  hierarchical linkage features, track-based statistical features, user-based statistical
  features, features derived from the k-nearest neighbors of the users, and features
  derived from the k-nearest neighbors of the items. No music domain knowledge was
  needed to create these features. We demonstrate that each group of features improved
  the prediction accuracy of the classification model. We also discuss the top predictive
  features of each category in this paper.'
