title: A Linear Ensemble of Individual and Blended Modelsfor Music Rating Prediction
abstract: 'Track 1 of KDDCup 2011 aims at predicting the rating behavior of users
  in the Yahoo! Music system. At National Taiwan University, we organize a course
  that teams up students to work on both tracks of KDDCup 2011. For trackÂ 1, we first
  tackle the problem by building variants of existing individual models, including
  Matrix Factorization, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Probabilistic
  Latent Semantic Analysis, Probabilistic Principle Component Analysis and Supervised
  Regression. We then blend the individual models along with some carefully extracted
  features in a non-linear manner. A large linear ensemble that contains both the
  individual and the blended models is learned and taken through some post-processing
  steps to form the final solution. The four stages: individual model building, non-linear
  blending, linear ensemble and post-processing lead to a successful final solution,
  within which techniques on feature engineering and aggregation (blending and ensemble
  learning) play crucial roles. Our team is the first prize winner of both tracks
  of KDD Cup 2011.'
