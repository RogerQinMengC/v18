title: Novel Models and Ensemble Techniques toDiscriminate Favorite Items from Unrated
  Onesfor Personalized Music Recommendation
abstract: The Track 2 problem in KDD-Cup 2011 (music recommendation) is to discriminate
  between music tracks highly rated by a given user from those which are overall highly
  rated, but not rated by the given user. The training dataset consists of not only
  user rating history, but also the taxonomic information of track, artist, album,
  and genre. This paper describes the solution of the National Taiwan University team
  which ranked first place in the competition. We exploited a diverse of models (neighborhood
  models, latent models, Bayesian Personalized Ranking models, and random-walk models)
  with local blending and global ensemble to achieve 97.45% in accuracy on the testing
  dataset.
