title: Taxonomy-Informed Latent Factor Models for Implicit Feedback
abstract: We describe a latent-factor-model-based approach to the Track 2 task of
  KDD Cup 2011, which required learning to discriminate between highly rated and unrated
  items from a large dataset of music ratings. We take the pairwise ranking route,
  training our models to rank the highly rated items above the unrated items that
  are sampled from the same distribution. Using the item relationship information
  from the provided taxonomy to constrain item representations results in improved
  predictive performance. Providing the model with features summarizing the userâ€™s
  rating history as it relates to the item being ranked leads to further gains, producing
  the best single model result on Track 2.
